//! Swimming for the walking controllers: once the water is deeper than the
//! character's chest it swims instead of walks. It floats with its head just
//! out of the water, strokes along where it looks (diving when looking down,
//! rising with jump, sinking with crouch), runs out of breath under water,
//! and climbs out over an edge it swims into. A [`Swimmer`] on the same
//! object tunes it; without one the defaults apply.
